# HeaderText

The `HeaderText` Widget is used to display large text at the top of the screen. It's used in the home page for the "**Medications**" title. Just give it a String you'd like to use as the title in the constructor.

## Constructor

```dart
HeaderText(String text) {
    this.text = text;
}
```

* `text` the text to display as the header.
